The following TLE is an exact fit to the pair of points you extracted from the video:

85 X 85 km

1 47097U 20087A   20351.73954002  .00000000  00000-0  00000-0 0    08

2 47097  43.5872  33.3960 0000100   0.0000  66.1702 16.71677480    02

Of course the object was not orbital by that time, so this is only a rough approximation of the trajectory.

I propagated it to theoretical impact using GMAT2018a. By trial and error I found that Cd=2.2 and A/m=0.0395 m^2/kg resulted in theoretical impact, within the NOTAM zone, about 28 km from the centre. Time of impact was 18:06:42 UTC. The actual landing would have been much later, due to the parachute.

Attachment 3 displays the ground track. The alternating red and white segments depict 10 s of flight. The information displayed by the balloon is for the start of the first segment. I see that the trajectory passed not far from the Jiuquan launch site.

Attachment 2 is the ephemeris from the observation site, which I call Xitancun 2 - named for the nearest place shown in Google Earth (the numeral 2 is to distinguish from the very slightly different location of the site of obs1). The time intervals are about 1 s.

Also attached are 2D and 3D kml files.
